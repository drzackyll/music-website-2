          Zack Adams is a New York songwriter and singer originally from Bowling Green, Kentucky.<br /><br />
          Adams’ first full length LP, Down the Line, will be released in April. It is a rock album written in the context of the birth of his son. Recorded in his mother-in-law’s basement closet, Down the Line captures some of the complex emotions that come with childhood, parenthood, and the passage of time. It will be available on vinyl, CD, and at most digital outlets.
